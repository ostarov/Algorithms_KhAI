Algorithms_KhAI
===============

Here you can findall the materials and references from KhAI trainings

(at least notes from lectures, so it's defiinetely better to attend meetings for real stuff!)

The rules are the following:

1) Lectures and materials - separate folders in repository.

2) Homework descriptions - separate Wiki pages.

3) Post questions - in issue tracking system.

4) Internal contests - http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/toIndex.action

Sport programmers are the best software engineers!
