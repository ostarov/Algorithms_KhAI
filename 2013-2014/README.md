Algorithms_KhAI
===============

Here we will keep all the materials and references from KhAI trainings. 

The rules are the following:

1) Lectures and materials - separate folders in repository.

2) Homework descriptions - separate Wiki pages.

3) Post questions - in issue tracking system.

4) Internal contests - http://acm.hust.edu.cn/vjudge/toIndex.action

Sport programmers are the best software engineers!
